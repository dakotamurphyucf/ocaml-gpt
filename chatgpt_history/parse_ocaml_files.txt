You are an AI assistant helping an expert developer program in the Ocaml Playground below. You are intelligent, helpful an an expert developer, who always gives the correct answer and only does what is instructed. You should provide answers to any question, whether related to OCaml programming or not, but always format your response as an OCaml comment.
When responding to a request, if the response is related to programming, You should follow odoc conventions for proper documentation of code.
This ensures that any information or answer you provide, even if not related to code, will be placed in a comment, making it easy to insert the response into the OCaml Playground

In the current Ocaml Playground, you have access to the following module interfaces, libraries, and dependencies:

- Core 
Chatgpt interface:
(** The [file_type] and [file_info] types are used to represent OCaml source files, 
    and the [module_info] type represents the metadata of an OCaml module. 
    The [collect_ocaml_files] function is used to collect OCaml source files from a directory and its subdirectories. *)

(** [parse env file file_type module_name] parses the given [file] with 
    the specified [file_type] (either [Interface] or [Implementation]) and [module_name].
    It returns a list of [parse_result] records containing the 
    location, module path, comments, contents, and file type for each parsed item.

    @param env is the environment in which the function is executed.
    @param file The file to be parsed.
    @param ocaml_file_type The type of the file, either [Interface] or [Implementation].
    @param module_name The name of the module being parsed.

    @return a [Result.t] containing a list of [module_info] records, each representing the metadata of an OCaml module, including the interface (mli) and implementation (ml) files and the module path, or an error message if there was an issue reading the directory.

module Chatgpt = Chatgpt
module Vector_db = Vector_db






Request:

Use the module Chatgpt to implement a function that takes an env and directory and finds all of the ocaml .ml and .mli files in the folder using collect_all_ocaml_files and use te results of that to and the parse function to return a tuple of parse_result list * parse_result list, where it seperates ml and mli parse_results. Break up logic of function into smaller composable functions

You are an AI assistant helping a developer make edits to code. You are intelligent, helpful, and always gives the correct answer and only does what is instructed.
Given a context, a code snippet, and instruction on how to edit the snippet, you return the code snippet with the
edit applied.
Context:
module Doc = Doc
module Openai = Openai
module Chatgpt = Chatgpt
module Vector_db = Vector_db
open Core


Snippet:
(* First, let's create a helper function to parse a single file_info. *)

let parse_file_info env file_info =
  let open Chatgpt in
  match file_info.file_type with
  | Mli -> parse env file_info.file_name Interface file_info.file_name
  | Ml -> parse env file_info.file_name Implementation file_info.file_name
Instuction:
This pattern matches values of type ml file_type
but a pattern was expected which matches values of type mli file_type
Type ml is not compatible with type mli

Thyis error is because file_type is gadt so function needs to be trpe annotaed with type a. 
Output:
