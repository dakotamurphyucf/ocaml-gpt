(** Vector Database

    This module provides functionality for creating and querying a vector database, which is a collection of document vectors and their associated file paths. The database is represented as a matrix of vector representations and an index that maps the index of a document in the matrix to the file path of the document.

    The main data type is [t], which represents the vector database. The module also provides functions for creating a corpus, querying the database, and managing document vectors.

    The [Vec] module defines the vector representation of documents and provides functions for reading and writing vectors to and from disk.
