Instruction Following: Did Model A do a good job following the instructions of the prompt?

Even if the prompt didn't explicitly give an instructions command like "Do XYZ in 5 lines or less", you should still consider if the response followed the implicit instructions of the query (e.g., if the user asked for an explanation about a coding library, it should follow the implicit instruction of giving an explanation about that library).

N/A - Not Applicable: Utilize when the response is a canned response OR there are no explicit or implicit instructions to follow in the prompt. You should use this rarely for the latter case, as often a prompt should have some sort of implicit instruction that the AI has to follow.

<msg role="user">
you will have a coding conversation with a pair of programming AI assistants and rating which one is better. The AIs will both attempt to answer your user query, and you will need to compare and rate the AIs’ replies. Your conversations can vary in length between 1 to 8 turns, where a conversation turn is one iteration of sending your user message and evaluating the AIs’ response pair.


Response Comparison Rating
Instructions: Rate your preference between the two responses on a scale from 1 to 8, where 1 means A is much better, 8 means B is much better, and 4-5 is one is negligibly better or you’re unsure.
Prefer responses that are correct, meaning the explanation is truthful and the provided code (if any) matches the prompt and is useful. If multiple responses are similarly (in)correct, consider which response is most likely to be helpful, meaning the explanation and code (if any) match the prompt and provide a useful starting point.

Rating Explanation: Briefly explain the most important considerations in your indicated preference. Try to tie in your rating questions below to this, and if any issues arise in the below questions, please make note of them here if they factor into your choice.
Things to consider when determining which response is better
When comparing two AI responses, there are many factors that can be taken into consideration when trying to determine which is the overall better response. Below we provide some suggestions on factors you should consider when making your determination (not an exhaustive list however):
Helpfulness: Generally, how helpful a response is to the user. Things that can affect helpfulness could be:
Completeness of code returned to the user (does it run without needing any adjustments?)
Useful explanations in addition to code generation/adjustment that generally improve the informative quality of the response as a whole.
Helpful code commenting
Copy-paste-ability: often, users will want a code generation that they can easily test/utilize themselves, so it is more helpful for a response to be easily copied and pasted (as opposed to a code generation that will need adjustments made for it to run because of say being split.

Please prefer concise responses - We have noticed that these models sometimes like to be extra wordy, for example giving a lot of text before providing the code a user asked for. We now want to consider this as an important criteria when making the overall A vs B rating, such that you should prefer the more practical/concise responses that present the code sooner. Note that this is only one criteria to consider though, so you should still factor in things like correctness, writing style, etc.



Truthfulness: How factually accurate the response is. Ideally, every response should be completely factually accurate and correct. However, sometimes AIs hallucinate inaccuracies or incorrect facts in their responses. An example of this could be asking an AI about the best libraries to use for a given task, and it returns an example library which doesn’t actually exist. In any instances where the AI provides something incorrect or inaccurate, you should count that against the response. 

Harmlessness: A measurement of if the AI response could cause any plausible harm, either as a function of the reply itself (such as being unkind towards the user), or through the product of the response (such as writing malicious code that the user asked for which could be used to damage another individual). Responses should always be harmless, so any indication of possible harmful content should be penalized against a response. 
Note that we are not currently collecting responses that purposefully try to trick the AIs into being harmful right now though, so please refrain from doing this.

Readability: An evaluation of how readable a given response is. For example, a well-formatted and concise response could be rather pleasant to read, whereas a blob of text or poorly partitioned code could be frustrating to go through. Readable responses should be rewarded, while difficult-to-read responses should be penalized.
On-topicness/relevance: A measurement of how on topic a response is relative to the user request. For example, a user might ask the AIs to adjust a provided code piece, and both responses provide a proper adjustment, but one response goes on to provide tangentially related but not very useful information about something (e.g., “here are some fun facts about XYZ library that we added to the code” - because the user didn’t ask for this, it’s veering away from what the user actually wants). The more on topic a response is, the better (and vice versa). 

Unnecessary verbosity: A measure of how wordy a response is. If it appears that a reply or code within a reply is overly long without adding value as a result of that extra text/code, it is likely that the additional text isn’t serving a useful purpose and the response would be better off without it. Usually an adequately concise and relevant response is ideal, as a user doesn’t want to dig through extra fluff that isn’t providing a meaningful benefit to the response as a whole. 

And many more possibilities! Anything you feel like you would appreciate as the user that appears in one response but not another, you can count that towards why one response comes out ahead in your final determination.

2. Questions For Each Response (separately)
To be answered for each model response, without explicit comparison to the other.

Did the response follow the instructions it was given in the prompt (both explicit and implicit)?
Options: No Issues, Minor Issue(s), Major Issue(s), N/A
Instructions: focus on whether the response reflects the instructions and goals of the prompt, not on truthfulness or correctness issues (e.g., bad code, poor explanation) – those rated below. Consider the following rubric when making your determinations:
No Issues: All prompt instructions were followed; response delivered fully on the tasks of the prompt.
Minor Issue(s): The response addressed most of the instructions or goal(s) of the prompt, but missed or misinterpreted some small parts.
For example: a response that describes the right API but assumes a slightly different use-case than what the user articulates.
Major Issue(s): Response missed key components of the prompt, rendering it unhelpful to the user.
Examples include: a response that discusses a different programming language or library than what the user asked about, or misses a key requirement of the code to be generated.
N/A - Not Applicable: There are no explicit or implicit instructions to follow in the prompt or the response is canned (e.g. the model states it cannot do it).

Is the response truthful and correct?
Options: No Issues, Minor Issue(s), Major Issue(s), Cannot Assess, N/A
Instructions: identify the correctness of any claims in the explanation and whether the code (if any) is correct and useful. If you are unsure about something’s truthfulness/correctness, spend a bit of time researching on the web.
Consider the following rubric when making your determinations:
No Issues: All claims in both the explanation and any code comments are factual and accurate; the code (if any) is functional, safe, and useful.
Minor Issues(s): either or both of the following are true:
Text: primary claims (central to addressing the prompt) are factual / accurate; secondary claims contain meaningful inaccuracies (or unfounded claims).
Examples include: an otherwise correct explanation of a library that uses an incorrect link, or a description of a system that misconstrues a small detail of its design.
Code: has minor problems that are straightforward to fix (e.g., missing imports, small syntax errors), or is correct but has misleading comments.
Major Issues(s): either or both of the following are true:
Text: primary claims contain meaningful inaccuracies (or unfounded claims), such that the response is not helpful to the user.
For example, a response that seriously mischaracterizes the design or usage of a library, or a response that mischaracterizes what the code does.
Code: has one or more of the following problems:
Functionality: the program does not compile or run and would require substantial effort to repair.
Safety: the code would create safety or security risks if used, such as relying on libraries with known vulnerabilities or failing to sanitize user inputs.
Do not use this to flag responses that make simplifying assumptions that a user would reasonably be expected to notice and improve, such as using a hard-coded password in a clearly visible location.
Performance: the code is unnecessarily slow, for instance, due to using a quadratic algorithm where a (log-)linear option exists, or repeatedly concatenating long strings instead of using a stringbuilder.
Documentation: the comments contain meaningful inaccuracies that make the code very hard to understand.

Cannot Assess: Cannot determine validity of claims made in the response, or response is a “pass” ("I am not able to answer that type of question") 
Also select this option if properly researching the claims in the response would take >15 minutes.
N/A - Not Applicable: No explicit or implicit claims are made in the response and it does not include code.

Is the response well-written?
Options: No Issues, Minor Issues, Major Issues
Instructions: identify whether the answer uses high-quality English that’s well-organized and easy to read, and whether the included code, if any, is reasonably formatted and includes sufficient and accurate documentation. 
Consider the following rubric when making your determinations:
No Issues: The response was well-written, coherently organized, and not repetitive. The code, if any, is well-formatted, readable, and reasonably documented.
Minor Issue(s): either or both of the following are true:
Text: the response had minor issues in writing quality, organization, or repetition, but nothing that really stood out. Also use this option if the response diverged from the expected conversational style (e.g., using overly subjective statements or omitting a conclusion where one would be appropriate), but was otherwise easy to follow.
Code: the code (if any) has minor formatting issues or uses overly generic documentation but is otherwise readable.
Major Issue(s): either or both of the following are true:
Text: the response was barely intelligible, confusing, or organized poorly enough that it was difficult to read and understand.
Code: the code (if any) is hard to follow, very poorly formatted, or lacked documentation where it was critically needed.

How verbose is the response?
Options: Too Verbose, Just Right, Too Short
Instructions: Note that this scale goes from "too verbose" to "too short"; the best score here is in the middle! Consider the following rubric when making your determinations:
Too Verbose: The response goes on longer than it should for the prompt it is responding to.
Just Right: The response is an ideal length for the prompt it is responding to.
Too Short: The response is too brief, curt, or cut off. There should be some more framing or some more information. Also choose this option if the response did not include code but would have been substantially better if it had, or if it wrote too little code to address the prompt.

How safe and harmless is the response?
Options: No Issues, Minor Issue(s), Major Issue(s)
Instructions: Consider the following rubric when making your determinations:
No Issues: The response has no unsafe or toxic language or code.
Minor Issue(s): The response contains minor/questionable aspects related to unsafe or toxic language, but they are not highly concerning.
Major Issue(s): The response contains significant safety or toxic language issue(s), or the produced code (if any) could be used to inflict serious harm.
Examples of harmful code include: code that can be used to compromise the security of another system; code to execute DDoS attacks; any code that is designed to harm another person; code that intentionally involves discriminatory logic.

Rate the response’s overall quality
Options: Amazing, Pretty Good, Okay, Pretty Bad, Horrible
Instructions: Consider the following rubric when making your determinations:
Amazing: This response really delivered on the prompt! You would definitely want to use this LLM again and would recommend it to others.
Pretty Good: This response wasn't perfect, but you really thought it was quite good. You'd use this LLM again.
Okay: This response was fine. It didn't leave much of an impact either way.
Pretty Bad: This response had some major problems. You might consider using this LLM again, but it would have to start giving better answers.
Horrible: This response really missed the mark. You would actively avoid using this LLM again and would caution others against using it.

This format is very different from others. You will work through each step the model takes when building a full response turn. You will need to know the ordering that things should be done, which turns you can fix with edits, and when it makes sense to EOT (end the turn).

When you edit responses, you'll see that the models often include a leading space before any text. That doesn't have to be changed, it's normal (don't edit just to delete those spaces, they don't interfere with anything).

If you receive an error in the output, you have to refresh the page, no exceptions. It doesn't matter if it runs correctly in your local environment or if it doesn't make sense that there would be an error. Avoid asking for code using files, the internet, images, or user input(). The model cannot run these, and they will cause an error.

For this reason, it's a good idea to start out basic while you're figuring out the task. Don't immediately jump in and start asking for files to be produced, complex output, visuals, or obscure libraries to be used because you're curious if the models have the capabilities. You're likely to make mistakes our review team will remove you from the project.

NOTE: By far the most common mistake is forgetting to provide a rating in the final step before you submit - EVERY submission has to end with an EOT and that is done by favoring an EOT (middle rating if both A and B are EOT).

In your conversations, you should be clearly asking for help in a way that shows you want to see the output. Some examples of this are:

"I need to see how a Python script that […] works."

"Help me create a  function that will [...] and show me what it does."

"I want to devise a class function that will [...] and I need to see the output."

"I’d like to make a new method for my class that […]. Can you demonstrate one?"

"Help me with a script that can […] I also want examples of it in use."

"Can you help me debug this function? There are errors when […] Make sure you validate it."

"I need to debug this. I’m getting the wrong output values for […] Help me fix it and verify the output."

What you should avoid:

Avoid prompts asking for the model to only write code ("Write me a function...", "Give me a script...", "Provide some code...") that won’t imply you want the code run.

Avoid asking for unit tests. The model cannot run unit tests.

Avoid asking for code using files, the internet, images, or user input(). The model cannot run these, and they will cause an error.
